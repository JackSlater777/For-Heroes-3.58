Maybe frequently asked questions
 
- Which WoG settings can I use?
Answer: Feel free to use any setting you like. The mod will automatically activate the option it needs if you select them.

- I want to customize some values for AI bonus, can I?
Answer: Sure, if you know what to edit you can change anything you like, but better ask Perry or Daemon for help.

- Why are some values and bonuses so absurd?
Answer: Heroes 3 is a manifold game, people play it differently, different maps and mods, a value you think is crazy might just be okay for the other guys, or maybe it is the other way around. That's when we start modding.


This mod also includes the AI Artifact Equipment Mod:
If possible AI will always equip the best artifact for every slot. This script checks the artifacts of AI heroes every day and equips better ones if available in a backpack.
You can conduct the priority order for equipping by reading the code. The lower an artifact is the higher the priority. This mod alone makes the AI much stronger without cheating.
